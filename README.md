The Guessing Game is a simple application where a user guesses a number between 1 and 100. The application indicates whether the user is getting closer or further away form the actual number. The user has 4 tries to guess. 

While this app was fairly simple to build, I enjoyed weaving my design skills with Javascript and jQuery.
